Project Proposal:
Type: Animation Game
Platformer
Our project will be a simplified platformer and possibly a metroidvania inspired game. It is inspired by games such as Mario bros and Hollow Knight. We will implement basic character motions such as standard character movement (left and right motion, and jump) based on user inputs. We plan to incorporate elements generally found in the genre including 2D-based timed levels with obstacles in which the designed character(s) must jump over or interact with in order to reach an "end of level goal". A simple combat mechanic (jumping on heads) will be present against rudimentary AI enemies. Possible features we plan to implement in the future once the core gameplay of movement and the level design are complete include more advanced combat with possible weapon and item progression, and computer generated level design.
