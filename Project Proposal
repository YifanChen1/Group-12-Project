Project Proposal:
Type: Animation Game
Platformer
Simplified platformer and possibly a metroidvania styled game. Inspired by games such as Mario bros and Hollow Knight, we plan to Incorporate elements generally found the genre including 2D-based timed levels and simple combat (jumping on heads) against rudimentary ai enemies. Possible features we plan to implement in the future once the core gameplay of movement and the level design are complete include more advanced combat with possible weapon and item progression and computer generated level design.
